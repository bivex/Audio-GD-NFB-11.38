Based on the Topping E30 manual, I can help you with the optimal settings for music listening. Here are the recommended settings:

1. **Output Mode**: 
   - For best sound quality, use "DAC" mode (not "Pre" mode) as this provides the cleanest signal path with fixed 0dB output
   - This ensures the most accurate reproduction of your music without any additional processing

2. **PCM Filter Setting**:
   - The default setting "F-3" (SHORT_DELAY_SHARP_ROLL_OFF_FILTER) is generally considered the best option
   - This filter provides a good balance between phase accuracy and frequency response
   - It's the manufacturer's default choice, which typically represents their recommended best performance

3. **DSD Filter Setting**:
   - The default setting "F-1" (39kHz) is recommended for most listening
   - This provides a good balance between detail and smoothness

4. **Screen Brightness**:
   - "L-2" (Mid) is the default and recommended setting
   - This provides good visibility without being too bright or too dim

5. **Auto Power Setting**:
   - Keep "A-O" (On) as the default
   - This helps protect your device by automatically entering standby when no signal is detected

Additional Tips:
- Make sure to use high-quality USB, optical, or coaxial cables for the best signal transmission
- The E30 supports up to 768kHz/32bit PCM and DSD512, so you can enjoy high-resolution audio files
- For USB input, you can play files up to 768kHz/32bit and DSD512
- For optical/coaxial input, you can play files up to 192kHz/24bit

These settings will give you the best possible sound quality from your Topping E30 DAC. The device has excellent specifications with very low distortion (<0.0003%) and high signal-to-noise ratio (>121dB), so with these settings, you'll be able to enjoy your music with great clarity and detail.
